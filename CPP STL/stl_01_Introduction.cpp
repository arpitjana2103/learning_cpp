/*

COMPONENTS OF STL :

1. Containers
--> Stores Data use, template classes

2. Algorithm
--> Sorting, Searching, Use Template Functions

3. Iterators
--> Object points to an element in a container
--> Handle just like pointers
--> Connects algorithm with containers

/*
STL Containers : Object which Stores data

Types of Containers :

1. Sequence Containers
=> Stores Data in Linear Fashion
   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
   Rndom Access : Fast
   Insirtion, Deletion at the Middle : Slow
   Insirtion, Deletion at the End : Fast
=> Exmple : Vector, List, Dequeue

2. Associative Containers
=> Stores Data with Direct Access
   Random Access : Slow
   Insirtion, Deletion at the Middle : Fast
   Insirtion, Deletion at the End : Fast
=> Exmple : Set, Map
      0
    /   \
   0     0

3. Derived Containers
=> Store Data with Real World Modeling
=> Exmple : Stack, Queue, Priority Queue
